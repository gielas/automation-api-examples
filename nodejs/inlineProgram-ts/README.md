yarn# Inline Program

This program demonstrates how to use Automation API with an `inline` Pulumi program. Unlike traditional Pulumi programs, inline functions don't require a separate package on disk, with an `index.ts` and `Pulumi.yaml`. Inline programs are just functions, can be authored in the same `index.ts` or be imported from another package. This example deploys an AWS S3 website, with all the context and deployment automation defined in a single file.

This example has a VSCode debug configuration that enables setting breakpoints within both the Automation API code, and things like `.apply` calls within the Pulumi program.

To run this example you'll need a few pre-reqs:
1. A Pulumi CLI installation ([v3.0.0](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/versions/) or later)
2. The AWS CLI, with appropriate credentials.
3. install deps: `yarn install`

Running this program is just like any other typescript program. No invocation through the Pulumi CLI required:

```shell
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
yarn run v1.19.1
$ ./node_modules/ts-node/dist/bin.js index.ts

To destroy the stack when you're done, invoke the program with an additional `destroy` argument:

```shell
$ yarn run start destroy
yarn run v1.19.1
$ ./node_modules/ts-node/dist/bin.js index.ts destroy

The resources in the stack have been deleted, but the history and configuration associated with the stack are still maintained.
If you want to remove the stack completely, run 'pulumi stack rm dev'.

## Debugging

This project includes VSCode debug configuration. Open VSCode from this directory and `F5` to start debugging, including `.apply` calls within the pulumi program itself. Give it a try!
